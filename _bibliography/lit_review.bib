Title         = {CS 224N: Final Project Extracting Family Trees from Literary Texts},
Abstract      = {We develop an NLP pipeline for extracting family trees from literary texts. To our knowledge, we are the first to attempt this task, although we build on existing work about extracting social networks from literary 
texts. At a high level, our pipeline has two stages. First, we identify characters 
in the text by clustering person mentions. 
Second, we attempt to link these characters by discovering family relationships. 
(The second stage is more difficult than the first.) In this report, we describe our system, evaluate its performance on a few texts, and suggest directions for 
improvement. 
Note: We request that this report not be 
distributed on the public CS224N website.},
