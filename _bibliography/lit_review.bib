  abstract     = {We develop an NLP pipeline for extracting family trees from literary texts. To our knowledge, we are the first to attempt this task, although we build on existing work about extracting social networks from literary texts. At a high level, our pipeline has two stages. First, we identify characters in the text by clustering person mentions. Second, we attempt to link these characters by discovering family relationships. (The second stage is more difficult than the first.) In this report, we describe our system, evaluate its performance on a few texts, and suggest directions for improvement. Note: We request that this report not be distributed on the public CS224N website.},

  abstract     = {Modern cities are engines of production, innovation, and growth. However, urbanization also increases both local and global pollution from household consumption and firms’ production. Do emissions change proportionately to city size or does pollution tend to outpace or lag urbanization? Do emissions scale differently with population versus economic growth or are emissions, population, and economic growth inextricably linked? How are the scaling relationships between emissions, population, and economic growth affected by environmental regulation? This paper examines the link between urbanization, economic growth and pollution using data from Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States between 1999 and 2011. We find that the emissions of local air pollution in these MSAs scale according to a ¾ power law with both population size and gross domestic product (GDP). However, the monetary damages from these local emissions scale linearly with both population and GDP. Counties that have previously been out of attainment with the local air quality standards set by the Clean Air Act show an entirely different relationship: local emissions scale according to the square root of population, while the monetary damages from local air pollution follow a 2/3rds power law with population. Counties out of attainment are subject to more stringent emission controls; we argue based on this that enforcement of the Clean Air Act induces sublinear scaling between emissions, damages, and city size. In contrast, we find that metropolitan GDP scales super-linearly with population in all MSAs regardless of attainment status. Summarizing, our findings suggest that environmental policy limits the adverse effects of urbanization without interfering with the productivity benefits that manifest in cities.},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of sentiment and issue salience on emotionally labeled responses to posts from political actors on Facebook (i.e., Reactions). We use an automated content analysis of Facebook posts and voter survey data in a multilevel negative binomial regression approach. Findings show that the sentiment of a post relates to the number of "Love" and "Angry" Reactions. Furthermore, if a post addresses an issue that constituents perceive as salient, this positively influences the number of "Angry" Reactions only. We also find that the effect of sentiment on "Angry" Reactions is highest when issue salience is low.},

title = {Tabs.do: Task-Centric Browser Tab Management},
abstract = {Despite the increasing complexity and scale of people’s onlineactivities, browser interfaces have stayed largely the same sincetabs were introduced in major browsers nearly 20 years ago. The gapbetween simple tab-based browser interfaces and the complexity ofusers’ tasks can lead to serious adverse efects – commonly referredto as “tab overload.” This paper introduces a Chrome extensioncalled Tabs.do, which explores bringing a task-centric approachto the browser, helping users to group their tabs into tasks andthen organize, prioritize, and switch between those tasks fuidly.To lower the cost of importing, Tabs.do uses machine learning tomake intelligent suggestions for grouping users’ open tabs intotask bundles by exploiting behavioral and semantic features. Weconducted a feld deployment study where participants used Tabs.dowith their real-life tasks in the wild, and showed that Tabs.do candecrease tab clutter, enabled users to create rich task structures withlightweight interactions, and allowed participants to context-switchamong tasks more efciently.},
