Initially, to resolve this issue, I thought about creating a chatbot that shows a family tree along with the chat UI, so that user can check if chatbot is accurately reflecting the family relationship. Since I thought a graph was the best way to represent a family tree and later transform it into a hierarchical structure, I started by using NetworkX. Then, while doing research about the combination of LLMs and graphs, I discovered the concept of knowledge graphs and realised that the graph I saved to draw the hierarchical family tree could also be used as external storage. This broadened the use of the graph and eventually led to this project.</p> <h3 id="what-does-kgraph-chatbot-do">What does KGraph Chatbot do?</h3> <ul> <li>Chat with GPT-4o in a friendly conversational style</li> <li>Stores family relationships in a knowledge graph (NetworkX)</li> <li>Extracts people, family relationships, and personal attributes from messages</li> <li>Detects conflicts with previously stored information</li> <li>Visualises an unhierarchical family tree as an interactive graph</li> <li>Moderates using OpenAI’s Moderation API</li> </ul> <h3 id="what-features-does-kgraph-chatbot-have">What Features does KGraph Chatbot have?</h3> <ul> <li>Family extraction: Automatically extracts family relationships such as spouse, parent, child, etc.</li> <li>Attribute extraction: Automatically extracts attributes such as age, occupation, personality, etc.</li> <li>Placeholder naming: Use placeholder when name is ungiven and later replace it the actual name when user provides.</li> <li>Conflict detection: Flags when the user provides information that conflicts with information that user earlier provided.</li> <li>Graph visualisation: Click the tree button to see family connections</li> <li>Content safety: Filters inappropriate content before processing</li> </ul> <h3 id="structure">Structure</h3> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Kgraph_chatbot/

</code></pre></div></div> <h3 id="attempted-approaches-not-in-the-final-version">Attempted Approaches Not in the Final Version</h3> <ol> <li> <p>Heavy prompt engineering for extraction and validation: I used multiple layers of prompt engineering to: detect if user input should be flagged; check if the input involves family relationships that can be parsed into (person1, relationship, person2) triple format and return the triples if possible; check if the input includes relationships between entities but not family relationships, and if so, parse into (entity1, relationship, entity2) triple format; and if the input contains no relational information, extract attributes. Using all these prompts made the programme so heavy that even getting a response for “hi” took more than one minute. This taught me the importance of balancing thoroughness with efficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Semantic search with knowledge graph When generating chat responses, I used semantic search alongside ChromaDB. While it generated accurate responses, there was an unresolved ChromaDB cache issue even with code that manually created collections. Additionally, storing information twice (in both the graph and ChromaDB) proved inefficient.</p> </li> <li>Alternative UI layouts I experimented with several UI configurations: <ul> <li>Multiple pages: First page for the chatbot, second page for the family tree. This proved inconvenient for users, as the users had to move back and forth in the pages.</li> <li>Split view: Chat on the left, graph on the right. This juxtaposition was inefficient unless the graph automatically updated with each user input, which would be computationally expensive.</li> </ul> <p>I realised that if I wanted an updated graph presented to the user, it would be better to let them choose when to view it. This led to the final design: a button to display the graph on demand rather than showing it by default.</p> </li> <li> <p>Creating a hierarchical family tree I attempted several approaches to create a hierarchical family tree:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Open-source Python visualisation packages: Most packages couldn’t graph top-down hierarchical family trees. One package that supported vertical hierarchical trees required a specific txt file format as input. Reformatting all the graph information to match this format was difficult enough, but dealing with placeholders added another layer of complexity—whilst my programme only creates placeholders when mentioned by the user, this package required complete generational information (for instance, all people who have a parent must have both a father and mother).</p> </li> <li> <p>Generation attribute approach: I tried assigning a “generation” attribute where the first person added to the graph would have generation 0, and all following nodes would have their generation calculated based on their relationship to the first person. However, several issues arose: the first person might not actually have family whilst the rest do; it placed aunts/uncles and parents in the same generation, requiring additional processing; there could be multiple distinct families in the chat; and distinct families could later merge. Manually hardcoding these edge cases proved too difficult.</p> </li> <li> <p>LLM-generated hierarchical formatting: I attempted to have the chatbot generate a hierarchical family tree by reformatting its response when users asked “can you give me a family tree of [person’s name]?” However, proper reformatting required extensive background information, which would need complex prompting.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Given these challenges, I opted for a non-hierarchical family tree for this project—essentially a relationship graph rather than a traditional hierarchical tree. This remains a key area for future development.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="remaining-issues">Remaining Issues</h3> <ul> <li>random shutdown issue: When a session has been open for more than 7 to 8 minutes, the programme slightly breaks (it appears as though pixels are broken at the edge of the chat UI) and performance decreases. While this could be a problem with my laptop or some other aspect of the code construction, I plan to investigate further.</li> <li>place holder and conflict detection issue: While it works most of the time, the placeholder sometimes fails when used alongside conflict detection. Since this occurs randomly, I would like to investigate further to pinpoint the specific condition where the error occurs.</li> </ul> <h3 id="future-plan">Future Plan</h3> <ul> <li> <p>identifying efficient prompt size: While I didn’t want to hardcode all possible family relationships and attributes, I also wanted to avoid long prompts due to computational cost and speed concerns. My initial approach to response generation was to use NER to identify relevant nodes whenever a user asked a question, then examine the edges. By gathering relevant nodes and edges to create context, the chatbot would generate a response. However, this approach didn’t work well—both accuracy and computational efficiency were poor. Balancing prompt length while effectively utilising the graph’s structure will be my next goal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visualising nodes and edges used for chat responses: This idea stemmed from the arXiv paper “Agentigraph: An interactive knowledge graph platform for LLM-based chatbots utilising private data.” While using a graph helps generate responses, creating an interactive visualisation provides users with more information and credibility. Based on this idea, I thought that displaying the edges and nodes used to generate each chat response alongside the response itself could add credibility to the answer and make users more engaged.</p> </li> <li> <p>creating a hierarchical family tree: While all my previous attempts have failed, I still want to resolve this issue. My current plan is to train a model by providing examples of hierarchical family trees and their corresponding family relations, then apply that separate programme to this project.</p> </li> </ul>]]></content><author><name>Summer Han</name></author><category term="general"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[what I have succeeded, what I will improve, what I have learned]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">not yet</title><link href="https://hangoeun16.github.io/blog/2025/not-yet/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="not yet"/><published>2025-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-12-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hangoeun16.github.io/blog/2025/not-yet</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hangoeun16.github.io/blog/2025/not-yet/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="short-notes-about-the-codes-that-i-forgot">short notes about the codes that i forgot</h1> <ol> <li>Visualisation of Label</li> </ol> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/c0_label-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/c0_label-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/c0_label-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/c0_label.jpeg" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>left: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)</code> right: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nx.draw(G, with_labels=False)</code></p> <ol> <li>Generating Path Graph Path Graph: a path graph $P_n$ is a tree with two nodes of vertex degree 1, and the other n-2 nodes of vertex degree 2.

As a Korean, I know tech blogs are practically a rite of passage among developers. But I’ve never been entirely sure whether “developer” fits my identity. After all, I never imagined myself like this.</p> <p>Math was the subject I hated most in high school. Yet through my 12th grade’s AP Calculus BC teacher, who taught formal proof, I discovered its beauty and ended up majoring in Mathematics at Grinnell College. Studying statistics as a concentration, I tried to draw a hard line between data science (worth exploring) and computer science (too technical, not for me). Then MPCS 51042—my first graduate-level CS course at the University of Chicago—made me question everything. “Why not CS?” it seemed to ask. If only someone had told me earlier that the logic of code mirrors the logic of mathematical proof, I might have double-majored in both.</p> <p>Every time I shift gears and move into a different area, I wonder: am I narrowing my focus, or just wandering? There’s this persistent fear that I might be too late—too late to enter the field properly. Sometimes I think I should have done more during undergrad.</p> <p>But at the same time, I feel a strange relief. That anxiety, the fear that I’ll never catch up with state-of-the-art skills or ideas, actually reveals my genuine passion to catch up and one day lead in this space.</p> <p>I’ve been thinking about starting a technical blog for a while. Now, my anxiety is upto the point that I cannot stop. So, this blog is my way to resolve my anxiety issue. I want to learn more. I want to be innovative. I want to enjoy. And I want to be proud of myself.</p>]]></content><author><name>Summer Han</name></author><category term="general"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time starting a tech blog.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with plotly.js</title><link href="https://hangoeun16.github.io/blog/2025/plotly/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with plotly.js"/><published>2025-03-26T14:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-26T14:24:00+00:00</updated><id>https://hangoeun16.github.io/blog/2025/plotly</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hangoeun16.github.io/blog/2025/plotly/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an example post with some <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/">plotly</a> code.</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">plotly

type="html" xml:base="https://hangoeun16.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[<p>May 14, 2024 We’re introducing a series of updates across the Gemini family of models, including the new 1.5 Flash, our lightweight model for speed and efficiency, and Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants. In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
