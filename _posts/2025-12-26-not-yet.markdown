# short notes about the codes that i forgot
1. Visualisation of Label
{% include figure.liquid path="/assets/img/posts/c0_label.jpeg" %}

left: `nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)` 
right: `nx.draw(G, with_labels=False)` 

2. Generating Path Graph
Path Graph: a path graph $P_n$ is a tree with two nodes of vertex degree 1, and the other n-2 nodes of vertex degree 2.
Simply saying, in $P_n,$ all $n$ vertices lie in a straight line.

{% include figure.liquid path="/assets/img/posts/c0_path.jpeg" citation="Source: Wolfram" %}


The example above is $P_2, P_3, P_4$ and $P_5$ from left to right. For $P_n$ we used code `nx.path_graph(n)` to generate it.

3. Page Rank
> A simple analogy to explain the page rank is surfer in the web that moves from one page to the other. Then, page rank
of any page is roughly the probability that the random surfer will land on a particular page. Since more links go to the
important pages, the surfer is more likely to end up there.
