I've been thinking about starting a technical blog for a while now. As a Korean, I know tech blogs are practically a rite of passage among developers. But I've never been entirely sure whether "developer" fits my identity.
After all, I never imagined myself like this. 

Math was the subject I hated most in high school. Yet through my 12th grade's AP Calculus BC teacher, who taught formal proof, I discovered its beauty and ended up majoring in Mathematics at Grinnell College. Studying statistics as a concentration, I tried to draw a hard line between data science (worth exploring) and computer science (too technical, not for me). Then MPCS 51042—my first graduate-level CS course at the University of Chicago—made me question everything. "Why not CS?" it seemed to ask. If only someone had told me earlier that the logic of code mirrors the logic of mathematical proof, I might have double-majored in both.

Every time I shift gears and move into a different area, I wonder: am I narrowing my focus, or just wandering? There's this persistent fear that I might be too late—too late to enter the field properly. Sometimes I think I should have done more during undergrad.

But at the same time, I feel a strange relief. That anxiety, the fear that I'll never catch up with state-of-the-art skills or ideas, actually reveals my genuine passion to catch up and one day lead in this space.

I've been thinking about starting a technical blog for a while. Now, my anxiety is upto the point that I cannot stop.
So, this blog is my way to resolve my anxiety issue. I want to learn more. I want to be innovative. I want to enjoy. And I want to be proud of myself.
