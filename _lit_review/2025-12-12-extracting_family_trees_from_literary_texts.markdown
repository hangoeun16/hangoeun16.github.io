### Why & How I Found This
For my final project in MPCS 57200 Generative AI, I built a knowledge graph-based chatbot that automatically creates hierarchical family trees from the information from chat. Even after the quarter ended, I remained curious about effective ways to generate family trees from text. I found this paper by searching "family tree nlp" in google; it appeared at the top. Two things caught my attention: first, it was also a final project, and second, it was written in 2015. I wanted to see how their approach compares to modern techniques and whether any aspects remain relevant today.
