### Why & How I Found This
While working through the [Introduction to Knowledge Graphs](https://github.com/city-knowledge-graphs/phd-course/blob/main/lectures/phd-course-kgs-aalborg-session-1-intro.pdf), I encountered description logics and semantics for the first time. Since these concepts were entirely new to me, I sought supplementary resources to build a foundational understanding. As I explored various materials, I became particularly intrigued by the use of formal mathematical languages for proving—grammars were my favourite part of mathematics. I found the formal languages used in description logics fascinating.
