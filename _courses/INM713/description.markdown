description: >
  This is a PhD-level course delivered at the University of Aalborg. The course
  [Knowledge Graphs in the Era of Large Language Models](https://github.com/city-knowledge-graphs/phd-course?tab=readme-ov-file)
  is based on [City's Semantic Web Technologies and Knowledge Graphs module](https://github.com/turing-knowledge-graphs/teaching/tree/main/city).
  Since the exact course code for the Aalborg version was not available, I used the course code from City, University of London.

  Course information sourced from the Knowledge Graphs Interest Group at the Alan Turing Institute:
