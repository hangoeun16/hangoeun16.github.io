This graduate-level course from Stanford University that highlights synthesis of AI, database systems and HCI in creating integrated intelligent systems centered around knowledge graphs. 
I studied this course through publically released [slides](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs520/) and [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/@vinaykchaudhri148), focusing primarily on conceptual frameworks rather than implementation code.

Motivation: While studying knowledge graphs independently, I found I needed video lectures to complement slide materials. I discovered this Stanford course which offers both comprehensive slides and recorded lectures.
